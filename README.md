# 🔄 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer  
**Understanding how sorting works through step-by-step animation**

This project visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms operate internally.  
It helps users understand comparisons, swaps, and the time behavior of each algorithm by animating the sorting process in real-time.

Supports visualizing large datasets and helps learners analyze sorting performance interactively.

---

## ⭐ Features
- Step-by-step **visual execution** of sorting logic
- Supports **5 sorting algorithms**
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Tracks **comparisons and swaps** to reveal internal operations
- Adjustable array size for performance observation  
- Clear view of algorithm behavior on best, average, and worst-case patterns

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- Each algorithm is implemented with internal state tracking
- DOM visual bars update on every swap or comparison
- Time complexity understanding improves as array size changes
- Designed for educational clarity and algorithm transparency
